  Good to see everyone so far is doing well! Seems like there's a lot of new
  people that have attended workcamp this year? Didn't catch where you guys are.
  Wish the best of luck to everyone there and with your crews/residents. I miss
  being able to attend workcamp, and hopefully someone out there is carrying on
  the "J-Money Tradition" on sleeping with their mouths open while getting their
  picture taken :-) How's silent football going? haha. Much love Faith
  Workcampers!
