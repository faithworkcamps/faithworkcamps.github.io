  Dear Workcampers,<br/><br/>Thank you for all you have done not only this week
  but throughout the year. I know this week has been special as you have helped
  others while enriching your own lives. The true test is to continue to
  practice what you have learned this week for the rest of your lives. It is
  challenge to live a Christian life in today's envinorment however, I am sure
  this week's Challenge Camp will help you as you travel along life's highway.
  May God bless all of you.<br/><br/>Much love,<br/><br/>Papa and Mama H.
