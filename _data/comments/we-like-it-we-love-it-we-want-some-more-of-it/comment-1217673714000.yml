  Crew 50!<br/> Thanks for the shout out. It was so awesome to see familiar
  faces and get to spend time with you guys. Although, I must say, I don't think
  you should trivialize what a stressful drive it was to get out to sites. The
  furthest site was a whole 2.9 miles away, not 2.6! Don't you know it's the 2.7
  mile mark that can drive a redshirt into overload? ;)<br/>I've heard of this
  silent football game at St. Louis. It sounds interesting; I think I need to
  hear some more specifics. Though, if it requires not talking, I think I stand
  as much of a chance as Mama H! <br/>At staff meeting Thursday night, you had a
  unanimous affirmation from the redshirts on your amazing servant hearts. My
  crew already misses all your smiles. Hope all is well.<br/>-Sam
  (Smalls)<br/><br/>P.S.-For the record: Cranberry trail mix is awesome!
