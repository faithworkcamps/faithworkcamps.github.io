  Keep up the good work, Workcampers.  As always, we are proud of the leadership
  that our youth exhibit during this week.  How exciting that the challenge camp
  is presenting such meaningful repairs to those in need.<br/><br/>We are
  praying for all of you but especially our prayer partners - Tyler, Will and
  Dan.  May this be another wonderful spiritual journey in your lives. 
  <br/>Mama and Papa H
