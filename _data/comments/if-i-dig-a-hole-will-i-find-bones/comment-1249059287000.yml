  Hello Workcampers and Faith Church friends.  Platte and I had a wonderful time
  seeing the evening program on Wednesday night and were glad to be a part of
  the devotions time.  The whole experience was terrific.  On Thursday morning,
  we visited Will&#39;s work site.  When we pulled up, Will was busy painting
  away and we heard he had been using the power saw!  We&#39;ve got a few
  projects at home........  He has a great crew and resident.  We think just
  being at Will&#39;s site was a God Sighting because of where it was located. 
  Will&#39;s site was the furthest one away but it was in the direction we
  needed to go.  Due to Platte&#39;s work schedule we had to be back in
  Allentown at a certain time and if Will&#39;s site had been in another
  direction we might not have been able to go! It was definitely as if there was
  a divine plan! And I am so glad we were able to see great kids in action
  helping their neighbor and serving God!  Good luck the rest of the week! 
  Cannot wait to hear more stories!  Love to all - Susan and Platte
