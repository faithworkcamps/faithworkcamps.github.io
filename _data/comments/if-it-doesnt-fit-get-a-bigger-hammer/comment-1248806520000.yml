  Hi Workcampers,<br />I don&#39;t have to tell you that this is a week that you
  will long remember. It is far removed from the Lehigh Valley
  &quot;bubble&quot;. A great opportunity to practice what we preach!<br
  />Beside being part of &quot;God sightings&quot; to your residents--let your
  crew know how you feel. Those Care Cards are priceless!! Acknowledge those
  random acts of kindness that you see.<br />God Bless!!<br />Carolyn Baittinger
