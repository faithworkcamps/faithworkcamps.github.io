  What an awesome way to end the first day of camp.  I&#39;m sure it was cool to
  know everyone&#39;s reactions at camp about the peeps and representing the
  valley!  Keep it real and representing Faith Pres all week, as you all touch
  the hearts of your residents and make new friends with the crews you&#39;re
  in.  Who knows, maybe next year will work better for me?  <br /><br />J-Money
