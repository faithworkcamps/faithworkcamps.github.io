  The Moose is gone.  Long live the Lost Dog!  Thanks for the opportunity to
  visit.  Maybe it was the collective warmth of the devotion room, but it semms
  to me as if every one of you has grown and shared and touched one another with
  an impressive understanding of what the week is all about.  Nice.  You da
  Peeps!  Till Sunday,<br />Andy
