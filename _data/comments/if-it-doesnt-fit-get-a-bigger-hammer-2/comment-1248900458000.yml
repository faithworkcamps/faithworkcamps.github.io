  Hi Workcampers!!<br />Your stories are inspiring!  While on vacation in MT,
  Big Jim was heard elaborating about all the wonderful work of our
  Workcampers.  The brothers were chatting about &#39;how&#39; to get their tiny
  Stanford church involved locally in helping the needy.  <br />Sorry the
  Lillegard clan couldn&#39;t physically be with you this week, but you were in
  our thoughts and prayers.  We did enjoy working on this year&#39;s project:
  soup cans.<br />Have a safe week and we look forward to hearing about all the
  stories and &quot;God sightings&quot;!  We know you are a true blessing to all
  your residents as you are &quot;Servin with your Peeps&quot;.  Peace!  Debbie
  Lillegard
