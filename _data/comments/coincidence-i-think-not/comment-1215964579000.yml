  Dear Dan and Workcampers,<br/><br/>Once again it sounds like you and all the
  work campers are off to a wonderful start. Each year I am amazed how God works
  his annonmous miracles on a daily basis. <br/><br/>Finding your way to Lisa's
  parents home, meeting friends of loved ones, being welcomed once again by
  strangers all by accident............I don't believe so.<br/><br/>Thanks to
  all of our workcampers for giving of their time, talent and financial
  resources to help others.<br/><br/>Look for other God sightings during your
  week of fellowship. I can assure you they are all
  around.<br/><br/>Love,<br/><br/>Dad
