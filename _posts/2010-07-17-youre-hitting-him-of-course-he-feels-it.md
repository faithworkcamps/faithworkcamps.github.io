Today was the last day of Workcamp, on this day most crews have finished their jobs and were ready for some rest after a long week of work. It was also the day when most crews presented the residents their gifts. Many crews gave the residents something to remind them of who had been there and what had been accomplish. Also today the residents were able to visit the workcampers during the evening ceremony and participate in the singing, praying, and other end of the week activities.

Today, when we were all sharing our god sightings Dan shared a story with us about how he and his crew had adopted their residents neighbour as their resident. He also mentioned how the neightbour, Ms.Dixie, had jumped in front of a moving van in order to have a group prayer with his work crew.
