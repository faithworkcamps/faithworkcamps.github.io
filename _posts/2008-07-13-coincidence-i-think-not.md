Our version of the mid summer classic got under way today as we met at FPC this morning in order to depart on our workcamp journey to St. Louis, MI. It was great to see so many of your smiling faces at the church! After a brief send off that included the musical sounds of Jack Decker, we began our journey west. We had planned on stopping at a rest area to consume the sandwiches we had packed, but we ended up stoping by Lisa&#8217;s family farm just west of Clarion, PA. It ended up being the perfect place to stop and spend some time together among the rolling hills of western Pennsylvania. What a beautiful home on 200 acres just off of route 80.

After lunch, it was on to our first nights accomodations in Perrysdburg, OH. Perrysburg is a suburb of Toledo on the Maumee River which we took a walk to today. As it ends up, Perrysburg, and specifically First Pres. Perrysburg, has some ties to FPC. When Lynn found out we were heading here, she called her father&#8217;s college roommate and he just happens to live 2 houses from the church. His family was was kind enough to stop by and bring ups Klondike bars. &#8220;What would you do for a Klondike bar?&#8221; We came to Ohio! The church seemed really familiar as we approached and Justin and Dan realized the workcampers had stayed at this same church in 2002 when they went to Lansing, MI! It is constantly amazing how each year we are greeted all across the country with open arms by fellow christians who know little about us except our name and where we are from.

All in all it was a great first day and the car ride didn&#8217;t seem nearly as long as it probably was. The newest campers, Meghan, Lauren, Rachel, Jackie, Grady, Karen, and Lisa took little time in becoming very active members of the group. We can all be proud of how inclusive our youth are with eachother and others they come in contact with.

Justin, aka J-Money, was once again successful in losing the first silent football game of the year. We&#8217;ll hand down a punishment tomorrow and try to get this blog posted a little bit earlier. Until then, keep the Faith!
