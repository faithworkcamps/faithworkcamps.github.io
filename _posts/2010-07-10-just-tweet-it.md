Not even the rain could stop a tremendous amout of supporters from showing up at this morning&#8217;s ridiculously early send off service. We thank all of you for your support, love, and prayers. It was great to have Andrew and the Millicks (cool band name&#8230;) be a part of the send off service as we will greatly miss them this year. Jay Kreider graced us with his excellent guitar playing and Terry Eck eloquently closed us in prayer and sent us on our way. We made it to Cedar Crest blvd. before encountering our first major problem&#8230; No coffee! half a mile later, the cargo van&#8217;s windshield wiper hit the self destruct button and we quickly found ourselves at Walmart solving both issues. The rest of our trip went quite smoothly but would have been much faster if the van was equiped with a restroom&#8230; We traveled through 5 states and celebraded each one of them with ferocious applause&#8230; and a pit stop&#8230;.

Phil impressed us all with his ability to consume energy drinks. At last count, his total intake consisted 316 grams of sugar, 800+ calories, and an unmeasurable amount of ounces. See previous mention of pit stop.

At approximately 7:15 PM, we arrived at Sharon Presbyterian in Charlotte, NC. The surrounding neighborhood is beautiful, the people incredibly friendly, and the campus is enormous! When you have a church campus map you know you have plently of places to put a fee sleeping bags&#8230;

This evening consisted of playing knock-out in the gym, silent football (Lynn and Rachel will be serving everyone breeakfast in bed tomorrow morning), and great fun bonding together as a group.

Tomorrow we will depart at 7:45 AM and hopefully arrive in Savannah, GA around noon for the start of camp. Until then, stay up to date with the twitter feeds and keep the Faith!
