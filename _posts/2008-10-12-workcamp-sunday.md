At today&#8217;s service, we celebrated this summer&#8217;s workcamp experience by tell our stories to the congregation. By clicking on the above image, you can watch a video that tells a small part of the story we lived in St. Louis, MI. Thank you to all who have supported this great program and to the campers as you truly &#8220;Loved out Loud&#8221; by putting God&#8217;s love into action. Until we blog again, keep the Faith!
