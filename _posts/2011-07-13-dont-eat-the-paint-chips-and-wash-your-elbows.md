Day 5 &#8211; What a great day in Middletown! The weather has finally cooled off to the mid 80&#8217;s and we had a half day of work. This afternoon we toured the <a href="http://www.beauverre.net/" target="_blank">BeauVerre Riordan Stained Glass Studio</a> before heading to the Cohen&#8217;s pool to cool off. A special thanks to the Cohens, a family we met at First Presbyterian Church last Sunday who offered their pool for our use and we are eternally grateful! Take a look at what today was all about&#8230;
