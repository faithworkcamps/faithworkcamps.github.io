Faith Workcamps is officially under two hours from home! We plan to be arriving home between 3:30 and 4:00 and can&#8217;t wait to see everyone.

Yesterday was a good travel day as the group drove around 4 1/2 hours to Cleveland, Ohio to our activity of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame where we saw many costumes, artifacts, and instruments of the various legends of rock. Many of the campers especially enjoyed The Doors exhibit, along with the Beatles.

After some good jammin&#8217; fun to the history of rock, the group took off for the First United Methodist Church of Brecksville. The church we were supposed to stay at did not respond, so Diane contacted her fellow crew leader from her worksite, who just so happened to be from the Cleveland area. To further add to this story, we were the last group to leave the school on Saturday morning and found a cooler sitting outside. This cooler just so happened to belong to the Breksville adult crew leader. Little did we realize we would be hand-delivering that cooler to the Breksville Church on our way home. A coincidence? I think not.

The group arrived at the very accomodating church and settled in as the adults grabbed a couple pizzas for dinner. Afterwards, the group&#8217;s last devotions were held (\*tear, tear\*) and the everpopular game of silent football was played once again. Tyler, aka &#8220;Captain Pronoun&#8221;, was the loser for having what must be the most pronoun usage the sacred game of silent football has ever seen. His punishment gave the group quite a laugh, as at the first rest stop on the road, Tyler happily took a plunger and shouted &#8220;PLUNGE INTO THE WORLD OF CHRST&#8221; to many of the pedestrians, who seemed frightened.

Our trip to St. Louis, MI is coming to a close. Although we are all sad to have left Workcamp, we are very excited to see our loved ones and to take a

non-yellowed water shower. Its been a spiritual week and one we won&#8217;t soon forget. Until next year, Keep the Faith!
