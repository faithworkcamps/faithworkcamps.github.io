It’s Wednesday afternoon and we’re writing to from the road on our way back to the school. We spent the afternoon in Memphis, TN were we visited Graceland and dined in the Blues capitol of the world, Beale Street. It was good to have an afternoon off after the working hard the first half of the week. We reached Elvis Presley Boulevard around 2:30PM to check out “the King’s” house. We were incredibly excited to see the gold lame and Jungle Room, but particularly pumped to see a piece of Americana. Soon after, we headed over to Beale Street to see the birth place of Blues. However, surprisingly, the most impressive sight on Beale Street was the vast amount of ketchup Will can eat- at least a full bottle in one sitting.

Currently, we’re en route back to the school for the evening program. Jayme will be rocking the drums and Greg will be playing the bass in the program. Hopefully this will spawn the birth of an FPC band. Following the program, we’ll have the opportunity to see the many “talents” of the workcampers in the variety show.

Between the work done yesterday and today on our sites, many of our crews are nearing completion. Not to worry though, there are still plenty of sites that still need lots of work and the crews that finish will be reassigned to those sites. Christy must be an expert painter because she has already completed the work to be done on her resident&#8217;s home. However, others like Lynn have hit a few bumps in the road and are just beginning their work. Relationships with our residents are continuing to grow as more and more residents are opening up to the campers. Stephanie H. is experiencing joys of servanthood this week through a little girl on her work site. After applying a fresh coat of paint to the little girl&#8217;s room, the little girl was overjoyed with the work that Stephanie&#8217;s crew had done that she insisted on taking pictures with them in her new digs.

As a youth group, we&#8217;re continuing to grow closer and closer. In the words of Emily, this is like having one big family of Faith. Tomorrow, we&#8217;re back to a full day at the work site. Until the God bless and keep the Faith!
